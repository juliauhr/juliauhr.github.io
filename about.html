    Hello!
    <br>
    I’m Julia Uhr, and I make augmented and virtual reality applications. 
    <br>
    I taught myself programming during law school and have eight years of experience in software development. After working at a law firm for a few years, both performing legal research and writing software to automate the firm’s workflow, I decided to go back to school to study technology. 
    <br>
    My interest in virtual reality began while I was getting a master’s degree in philosophy, focusing on applied ethics and tech. I taught myself Unreal Engine and webXR, and received numerous fellowships, grants, and awards for my VR projects, including a Best of Show award from the Broadcast Education Association and an Epic Megagrant. 
    <br>
    Now I’m getting a PhD in Creative Technology and Design at the ATLAS Institute, where I focus on designing AR, VR, and 3D user interfaces that are simultaneously useful and enjoyable.
